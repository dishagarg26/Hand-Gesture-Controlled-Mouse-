# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Mouse-
This project presents a hand gesture-based mouse controller using computer vision. Using a webcam and real-time hand tracking, the system translates gestures into mouse operations such as cursor movement and clicking. The goal is to create a touchless interface using only a standard camera and open-source tools.
